# Deployment Status - Complete Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Backend (Render)
- **URL**: https://home-treding-api.onrender.com
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Running successfully
- **Port**: 10000 (configured correctly)
- **Root endpoint**: Working (returns API info)

### Frontend (Vercel)
- **URL**: https://home-treding.vercel.app
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed successfully
- **Build**: Completed without errors

## ‚ùå Current Issue

**Problem**: Frontend is still calling `http://localhost:5000` instead of production backend

**Evidence from errors**:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/broker/list net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
POST http://localhost:5000/api/broker/connect-manual net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

## üîç Root Cause

The `fix-api-urls.js` script we ran didn't properly update all files. Some components are still using hardcoded localhost URLs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Required

You need to **manually update** the Render environment variable AND **redeploy the frontend** with a proper fix.

### Step 1: Update Backend CORS (Render)
1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Select `home-treding-api`
3. Environment tab
4. Add/Update: `FRONTEND_URL=https://home-treding.vercel.app`
5. Save (will auto-redeploy)

### Step 2: Verify Frontend Environment Variable
The `.env.production` file has the correct URL, but it seems the build isn't picking it up.

**Current setting in `.env.production`**:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://home-treding-api.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Force Vercel to Rebuild
Since the environment variable is correct but not being used, we need to:
1. Make a small change to trigger rebuild
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy

## üìù Quick Fix Commands

I'll create a script to verify all URLs are correct and trigger a rebuild.

## Current Deployment URLs

- **Frontend**: https://home-treding.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://home-treding-api.onrender.com
- **Backend Health**: https://home-treding-api.onrender.com/health

## Next Steps

1. Update Render CORS settings (FRONTEND_URL)
2. Verify frontend build picks up environment variables
3. Test connection between frontend and backend
