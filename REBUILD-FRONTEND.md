# How to See the New Strategy Page

The old Strategies.tsx has been deleted and the app is now using StrategiesNew.tsx, but your browser is showing cached content.

## Steps to Fix:

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache (Quickest)
1. Open your browser
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh the page with `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)

### Option 2: Rebuild Frontend
If you're running the frontend locally:

```bash
# Stop the frontend if running
# Then in the frontend directory:
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

### Option 3: Force Rebuild on Vercel
If you're viewing the deployed version:

```bash
# Push a small change to trigger rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger rebuild"
git push
```

## What Changed:

✅ **Old File Deleted**: `frontend/src/pages/Strategies.tsx` 
✅ **New File Active**: `frontend/src/pages/StrategiesNew.tsx`
✅ **Routing Updated**: App.tsx imports from StrategiesNew

## New Features in StrategiesNew:

1. **Strategy Templates Tab** - With performance graphs
2. **Duplicate Dialog** - Clone existing strategies
3. **Deploy Dialog** - Full deployment options (broker, quantity, max profit/loss, etc.)
4. **User-Specific Data** - Each user sees only their strategies
5. **Real CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete all working

## Verify It's Working:

Once you clear cache/rebuild, you should see:
- 5 tabs: Create Strategy, My Strategies, Deployed Strategies, Strategy Template, My Portfolio
- Strategy Template tab shows cards with graphs
- Create Strategy button opens a dialog with template selection
- All features are functional (not demo data)
