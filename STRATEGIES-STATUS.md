## Known Issues

⚠️ **Diagnostics showing stale errors** - These are TypeScript cache issues:
- Line 261: '}' expected - FALSE POSITIVE (syntax is correct)
- Line 92: Type error - FALSE POSITIVE (component is properly typed)

## How to Verify

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + F5
3. **Check deployed version**: https://home-treding.vercel.app/strategies

## Next Steps

If you're still seeing the old page:
1. The browser is showing cached content
2. Vercel needs to rebuild (triggered by latest push)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
