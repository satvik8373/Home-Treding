# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Vercel is looking for `frontend/frontend/package.json` instead of `frontend/package.json`.

## Solution: Configure Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard

### Steps:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **General**
4. Find **Root Directory** section
5. Click **Edit**
6. Enter: `frontend`
7. Click **Save**
8. Go to **Deployments** tab
9. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

## What This Does
- Tells Vercel to treat the `frontend` folder as the project root
- Now `npm install` and `npm run build` will run in the correct directory
- The `vercel.json` commands are simplified to work from the frontend directory

## Alternative: Deploy Frontend Only

If the above doesn't work, you can:

1. Create a new Vercel project
2. Import only the `frontend` folder
3. Or push frontend to a separate branch/repo

## Current Configuration

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build"
}
```

This assumes Vercel's root directory is set to `frontend` in the dashboard.
